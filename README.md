### Where is my timetable?
Borrowing the often used analogy of functions as factories (and timetables as the products), this is not a factory or the output of the factory; this is merely the blueprint for building a factory.

### That's so dumb! I just want my timetable!
Ok.

### I found a bug, how do I tell you?
Submit an [issue](/../../issues), but please check if there is an existing one similar to yours.

### I was late because the timetable was wrong!
Not a question. If you suspect there was a bug that caused it, see the answer to the question above.

## Install
Note: if you are just using the timetable, you don't need to install anything! This is for developing the site.
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
